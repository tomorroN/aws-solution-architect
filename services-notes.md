  the underlying host.
- A **launch template** is similar to a **launch configuration**, in that it specifies instance configuration information. 
  It includes the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and other parameters 
  used to launch EC2 instances. However, defining a launch template instead of a launch configuration allows you to have 
  multiple versions of a launch template.
- Using **Amazon CloudWatch** alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover 
  your EC2 instances

**Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)** - high-performance block storage service designed for use with EC2 for both throughput
and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale. By default, the root volume for an AMI backed by Amazon EBS is deleted
when the instance terminates. When you create an encrypted Amazon EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type, 
data stored at rest on the volume, data moving between the volume and the instance, snapshots created from the volume and
volumes created from those snapshots are all encrypted. It uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMK)
when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots. Encryption operations occur on the servers that host Amazon EC2 instances,
ensuring the security of both data-at-rest and data-in-transit between an instance and its attached Amazon EBS storage.

**Network Load Balancer** - functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle
millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target
group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.
- Request Routing and IP Addresses
  - If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified
    in the primary network interface for the instance. The load balancer rewrites the destination IP address from the data packet
    before forwarding it to the target instance.
  - If you specify targets using IP addresses, you can route traffic to an instance using any private IP address from one 
    or more network interfaces. This enables multiple applications on an instance to use the same port. Note that each
    network interface can have its security group. The load balancer rewrites the destination IP address before 
    forwarding it to the target.

**Gateway Load Balancer** - new type of load balancer that operates at layer 3 of the OSI model and is built on Hyperplane,
which is capable of handling several thousands of connections per second. Gateway Load Balancer endpoints are configured
in spoke VPCs originating or receiving traffic from the Internet. This architecture allows you to perform inline inspection
of traffic from multiple spoke VPCs in a simplified and scalable fashion while still centralizing your virtual appliances.

powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.

When you create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment, you can specify an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use instead of the
standard Elastic Beanstalk AMI included in your platform version. A custom AMI can improve provisioning times when instances
are launched in your environment if you need to install a lot of software that isn't included in the standard AMIs.

**Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)** - is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging 
service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SNS cannot be used 
to decouple the producers and consumers for the real-time data processor as described in the given use-case.

**Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)** - offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and
decouple distributed software systems and components. SQS cannot be used to decouple the producers and consumers for the 
real-time data processor as described in the given use-case.
- Amazon SQS offers two types of message queues. 
  - **Standard** queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. 
  - **FIFO** queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. 
    By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300 messages per second 
    (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second) without batching. Therefore, using batching you can meet a throughput
    requirement of upto 3,000 messages per second. The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. 
    The suffix counts towards the 80-character queue name limit. To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether
    the queue name ends with the suffix.
